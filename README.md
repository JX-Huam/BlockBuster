# About this project
This is a final project for the course programming technique in UTM (University Technology Malaysia). I formed a group of 3 with me as the team leader worked together to design and finish this project.

There are a few main concepts we need to implement which are:
- Array of objects
- Associations (aggregation and composition)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Hence, the block buster game is the final result of our project. I first introduced this idea to my other two members and after a few discussions, we decided to continue this idea.

Block buster is a tetris-like game, but in reverse form. We as the player we shoot different color blocks from below to upward. There are random generated color blocks slowly drop from above. We need to shoot blocks to match at least 3 same color block to make them dissapear and get scores. Otherwise the shot block will stay at that final position. After 5 shots, the upward block will drop one line. We need to get as much scores before the block touch the player at the bottom.
